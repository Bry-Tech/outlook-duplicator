## ✨ What does the add-in do?

This Outlook add-in is intentionally **very simple and minimalistic**:

- It reads the **Subject** and **Body** of a selected calendar event.
- It creates a **new event**, placed right after the original one.
- That's it – no clutter, no configuration.

📸 See the GIF for an example:  
_One click – and your meeting is duplicated._
